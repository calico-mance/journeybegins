# 1) Exercise instructions were to introduce a typo that generates an error 
# message and try to make sense of the message. (done)
# 2) Final instructions were to introduce a typo that wouldn't generate an error 
# message. I assume they meant by misspelling a word in the quoted string, to 
# show Python doesn't spell check. (done)
prit('Hello Python world!')
# Below example won't cause an error message to appear, as Python doesn't care 
# about proper spelling within a string.
print('Hello Pytn world!')
